Working with new features:
	- Create a new branch for new features in local repo
	- Once features have been added, push to remote repo: git push origin <branch_name (not main) >
	- If you're the owner of the remote repo, click on compare pull requests and if ok, merge it to main using web and delete the added 		newly added branch
	- After successfully merged, move back to main in local branch to delete newly developed features if you want, or you can keep it 
		for feature testing and restore point
	- Do a 'git fetch --prune' to clean up outdated branches.
